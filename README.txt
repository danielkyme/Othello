We spent much of our time for this project coding together, so many parts of the
assignment were done together. Daniel spent more time on building SimplePlayer
and designed the heuristics and Ankush spent more time on the minimax algorithm
and altered the heuristics to better our AI.

We started out with our random SimplePlayer algorithm and then implemented
Heuristics and minimax algorithm. At first, we realized that the depth was not
properly working (i.e. a depth of 10000 ran at the same rate as depth of 2). So,
we fixed that issue first off and tested it out. Also, the heuristic given
penalizes "good" moves, which we fixed by altering the heuristic.
We feel that our new minimax algorithm will be better able to win the tournament
since the depth portion is working properly now. Also, we refined our Heuristic
so that the point system is different, so we feel confident that we will fare
well.
